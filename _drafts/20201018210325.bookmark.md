Sounds Good: August 7, 2020
===========================

Remember two whole weeks ago when I proudly pronounced that this newsletter was a weekly? Classic Craig! Sorry about that. The good news is I've been working on a new project that will be announced next week---really excited to share that with you.

(Just writing that opening paragraph transported me back to the good ol' days of personal blogs, when seemingly every post I read or wrote started out with an apology for not writing recently. It seems almost quaint now, when the very notion of apologizing---*for anything*---has been almost entirely excised from our political and social discourse. But to harken back to those glorious days, I ran a search for "[sorry it's been a while](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ALeKk02O5W-EtJ1ecDSbUHGqZm7HW06dYg%3A1596830404104&source=hp&ei=xLItX8WGA4GltQal77KoBg&q=site%3A*.blogspot.com+%22sorry+it%27s+been+a+while%22&oq=site%3A*.blogspot.com+%22sorry+it%27s+been+a+while%22&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECCMQJzoFCAAQkQI6BAgAEEM6DgguELEDEIMBEMcBEKMCOggIABCxAxCDAToHCAAQsQMQQzoICC4QxwEQrwE6CwguELEDEMcBEKMCOgUIABCxAzoHCAAQsQMQClDLEFiBa2DYbGgAcAB4AIABrAGIAcATkgEENDMuMpgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXo&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjF-P_n8InrAhWBUs0KHaW3DGUQ4dUDCAw&uact=5)" on blogspot.com. The number of results? About 12,300. You should read a few.)

In the meantime, I didn't want to let Bandcamp Friday pass us by without recommending some interesting sounds that are worth your hard-earned dime. Stream 'em for free, and if you like 'em, put your money where your ears are. As a reminder, on the first Friday of the month, Bandcamp waives their fees and puts more money in the hands of musicians. Get at it!

    Did you ever wonder what would happen if [noted tape loop maestro](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/577-the-disintegration-loops-i-iv/) William Basinski picked up a saxophone and made a lounge album with his young protege, Preston Wendel? Wonder no more! Since so much experimental / electronic music is brutally self-serious, it's always refreshing to come across something that embraces camp while still sounding aesthetically interesting. And if you like your good-natured electronic music of a smoother variety, I also highly recommend Todd Terje's *[It's Album Time](https://open.spotify.com/album/4pefQ21iSk8hdnxw3WSB5Y?si=m9Llh-EATqiFV5YQX4IZmg)*.\

    Money Tapes is a new label from Chicagoan Ed Bornstein, who I knew from the Iowa City scene and who is an all-around great musician and sound recordist. This new project produces mix tapes (on tape, of course, or digitally) and gives 100% of the money after production costs to charities in and around Chicago. Ed's contribution is a series of around twenty "minute dubs," one-minute slices of beats and samples and at least one cover song. I listened this afternoon and loved it. The money this month goes to the [Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Oppression](https://www.caarpr.org/).\

    Chants is the electronic project of Jordan Cohen from Madison, and this amazingly named collection is an archival release featuring instrumental beats he made between 2013-2015. In all seriousness, I will be stealing some of these beats for use in my podcast (if I ever make another podcast). And you can, too!

Talk next week---I hope...

Craig
