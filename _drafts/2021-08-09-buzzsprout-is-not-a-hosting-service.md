description: Buzzsprout does not host your files. It ingests them, re-encodes them, and charges you extra if you want them not to.

Podcasting started with a relatively simple premise, which made a lot of sense at the time. You post some audio files to a website, through a web hosting service that you pay for, and then 


Back in May I took a trip up to Red Cliff, Wisconsin, to meet with tribal leaders and talk about stuff.

But when I re-downloaded the file, something was off: the filesize, which I noticed right away was only half as big as the one I uploaded. I panicked, figuring something weird had happened when bouncing a file where I only ended up with half of my episode.

But what actually happened is that Buzzsprout *mixed my file down to mono*.

Panicking, I google some stuff and came across [this post from Jim Thornton](https://timthorntonmusicwriting.net/2020/07/25/buzzsprout-a-rhapsody-in-mono/) confirming my worst fears. Buzzsprout was deliberately mixing my file down to mono.

In other words, to get a professionally mixed file to sound the way you paid professionals to mix it, you have to pay Buzzsporut a $6 ransom for something called “Magic Mastering”—AND THEN TURN THAT FEATURE OFF. If that seems insane, well, it is. Needless to say I’ll be switching to a new service for this show for the second season, and recommending all my clients steer clear of Buzzsprout going forward.
