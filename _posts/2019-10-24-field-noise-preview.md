description: "Field Noise is a show about the role of sound in our everyday lives. It’s a show about people who make sounds and people who listen to them. It’s a show about music and noise and silence and the politics of those categories. It’s a show about how disability, gender, race, and class are central to what we think about as “technology.” And it’s a show that is very much still finding its voice. Here’s a preview."

These last few weeks I've been spending a lot of time thinking about how a show about sound should sound, and for me that has meant a) procrastinating, and b) making little scenes without worrying too much about the narrative. I've been grabbing short pieces of interviews and mixing them with archival audio, some music, maybe some sound effects. Once I had all of these interesting interview clips sitting around, I wanted to share them. The snippets that comprise this trailer come from stories about [old reading technologies](https://soundstudiesblog.com/2015/01/05/optophones-and-musical-print/), [new listening technologies](https://www.stevensblog.co/blogs/smart-speakers-speech-recognition-and-accessibility), the history of violin making, regional language differences, the politics of jet noise, and more. 

The voices you hear come from the bodies of: [Harvey Lauer](https://archive.org/details/visotonerpersona0000harv), [Mara Mills](http://maramills.org), [Max Rammer](https://soundcloud.com/thatsjustlife/sets/2125a), [Sam Zygmuntowicz](http://strad3d.org/cms/), [Alex Libin](https://ajbcoaching.com/athlete.cfm?aid=559), [Joan Hall](https://dare.news.wisc.edu/video/index.html), Alma Princip, [Quincey Whitney](http://www.quincywhitney.com), [Steven Aquino](https://www.stevensblog.co) (and Harvey Lauer again). The music is by the Minneapolis band [Inside Voice](https://www.instagram.com/inside_voice_band/). They were generous enough to share some demos with me and are cutting their debut record right now. I can’t wait to hear it.

The first "real" episode of Field Noise is coming soon(ish?), but in the meantime, I hope this gets you a tiny bit as excited for this project as I am.
