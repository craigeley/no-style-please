A little but busy at the moment, but I didn't want to let Bandcamp Friday pass us by without recommending some interesting sounds that are worth your hard-earned dime. Stream 'em for free, and if you like 'em, put your money where your ears are. As a reminder, on the first Friday of the month, Bandcamp waives their fees and puts more money in the hands of musicians. Get at it! And for more, check out [last month's recs](/bandcamp-friday-july.html) as well.

Did you ever wonder what would happen if [noted tape loop maestro](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/577-the-disintegration-loops-i-iv/) William Basinski picked up a saxophone and made a lounge album with his young prot√©g√©, Preston Wendel? Wonder no more! Since so much experimental / electronic music is brutally self-serious, it's always refreshing to come across something that embraces camp while still sounding aesthetically interesting. And if you like your good-natured electronic music of a smoother variety, I also highly recommend Todd Terje's¬†*[It's Album Time](https://open.spotify.com/album/4pefQ21iSk8hdnxw3WSB5Y?si=m9Llh-EATqiFV5YQX4IZmg)*.

ü§ë [Ed B,¬†](https://moneytapes.bandcamp.com/releases)*[Money Tapes 01: Minute Dubs](https://moneytapes.bandcamp.com/releases)*

Money Tapes is a new label from Chicagoan Ed Bornstein, who I knew from the Iowa City scene and who is an all-around great musician and sound recordist. This new project produces mix tapes (on tape, of course, or digitally) and gives 100% of the money after production costs to charities in and around Chicago. Ed's contribution is a series of around twenty "minute dubs," one-minute slices of beats and samples and at least one cover song. I listened this afternoon and loved it. The money this month goes to the¬†[Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Oppression](https://www.caarpr.org/).

Chants is the electronic project of Jordan Cohen from Madison, and this amazingly named collection is an archival release featuring instrumental beats he made between 2013-2015. In all seriousness, I will be stealing some of these beats for use in my podcast (if I ever make another podcast). And you can, too!
