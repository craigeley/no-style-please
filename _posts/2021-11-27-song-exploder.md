Song Exploder is a podcast where musicians take apart their songs, and piece by piece, tell the story of how they were made. Each episode is produced by host and creator [Hrishikesh Hirway](https://hrishikesh.co/) in Los Angeles. Using the isolated, individual tracks from a recording, Hrishikesh asks artists to delve into the specific decisions that went into creating their work.

Craig works with Hrishikesh to edit the scripts and audio of the show, starting with [episode 217](https://songexploder.net/mustafa).
