Just Three is a podcast from the [Columbia Center for the Study of Social Difference](https://www.socialdifference.columbia.edu) that highlights the programs and projects being done in and around their working groups. The format of the show involves asking each guest the same three questions:

-  how does your work engage with issues of social justice?
-  What do you see as the biggest social justice challenge of our current time?
-  How can we foster ethical and progressive social change?

> Hear artists, activists, scholars, and others from around the world talking about how their work intersects with social justice, and how we can confront the biggest social justice challenges of our time. Hosted by [Catherine LaSota](https://www.socialdifference.columbia.edu/faculty-/catherine-lasota).

Field Noise edits and mixes the show and consulted on the series before and throughout the launch.
