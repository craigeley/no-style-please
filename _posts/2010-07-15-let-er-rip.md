Welcome to Field Noise, a blog that will be devoted to found sound, weird records, music, and a combination of those things through a series of mix tapes.  I’ll be uploading some vinyl records on occasion, and since I’m guessing some of you readers might be tech geeks (like me) or audiophiles (not me), here’s a quick note on how I’m going to rip the vinyl I post here: I’m recording using a [Numark PT-01](https://www.numark.com/product/pt01), running the audio via RCA cables into a [M-Audio Firewire Audiophile](https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/m-audio-firewire-audiophile) and recording to stereo in [Pro-Tools M-Powered 8](https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/digidesign-pro-tools-8) at 44.1kHz and 16-bit depth.  Then I’m using [XLD](https://tmkk.undo.jp/xld/index_e.html) to convert the WAV files to LAME V0 MP3s. So, yeah: lossy format, cheap ass turntable and terribly stylus.  (For cassette rips I’m just lining-in a Walkman!) I also keep all the crackles and pops in.  Gives it more character.  I know there are better ways, but this is my way (at least for now).
