Phantom Power is an academically-oriented podcast about sound art, music, and sonic culture.

> Phantom Power is an aural exploration of the sonic arts and humanities that launched in 2018. Hosted by media scholar Mack Hagood, the podcast explores the sounds and ideas of artists, technologists, producers, composers, ethnographers, historians, cultural scholars, philosophers, and others working in sound.

I contributed story editing and mixing on three episodes:
- Ep. 8, [Test Subjects](http://phantompod.org/2019/02/01/ep-8-test-subjects-mara-mills/)
- Ep. 12, [A Book Unbound](http://phantompod.org/2019/03/28/ep-12-a-book-unbound-jacob-smith/)
- Ep. 17, [The Sounds of Silents](http://phantompod.org/2019/11/01/ep-17-the-sounds-of-silents/)

I mixed two other episodes:
- Ep. 10, [Animal Control](http://phantompod.org/2019/03/01/animal-control-mandy-suzanne-wong-robbie-judkins-colleen-plumb/)
- Ep. 18, [Screwed and Chopped](http://phantompod.org/2019/12/20/screwed-and-chopped/)
