description: An audiobook of Audubon's journals.

Today marks what would be the 226th birthday of Mr. John James Audubon. Because he died in 1851, Audubon often falls outside of my historical research on birds, even though he looms so incredibly large in the history of ornithology in the United States. I’ve tended more toward the work of the [ghost-smelling](https://books.google.com/books?id=YsQ-AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA81&dq=coues+ghost+smeller&hl=en&ei=Xjq3TcWpHsfv0gHGpfDbDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg%23v=onepage&q=coues%20ghost%20smeller&f=false) Elliott Coues and the drawings of [Louis Agassiz Fuertes](https://rmc.library.cornell.edu/Fuertes2000/BirdView-From=bbn&QY=c&Size=2&BirdID=2305.asp.html)—who worked together on a book called [Citizen Bird][3]. But it’s JJ’s birthday, and as a present to all of you I’ve got a de-accessioned Iowa City Public Library cassette tape called Audubon’s *Episodes*.

Interestingly, the "episodes" are pieces of Audubon's journal that were assembled by Maria R. Audubon with the help of none other than Elliot Coues in a volume from 1899. You can read the full text of that [here](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Audubon_and_His_Journals).

The audiobook is a professionally done double cassette release from the 90s, which you can download
