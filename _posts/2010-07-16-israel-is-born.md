description: Ripping some vinyl of an old record called Israel is Born
---

One of the scholars/sound geeks who has caught my attention recently is [Josh Kun][1], who beside editing an [upcoming special issue on sound][2] for the American Quarterly, is also one of the curators of [Jews on Vinyl][3], showing until September 5th at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles. While that exhibition seems to mainly focus on music, it reminded me of an old spoken-work/field recording album I had lying around: *Israel is Born*. The copy I have is in pretty good shape, even though the cover is nearly destroyed. You’ll hear some cracks and pops in the recording for sure. It was written and narrated by Arthur Holtzman, with “authentic Israeli events” recorded by Ralf Hellinger. It was put out by Caedmon in 1953 (catalog no. TC-1014).

Download it [here][4], and check out my notes on how I rip things [here][5].
