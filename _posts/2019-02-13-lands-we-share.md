---
> The Lands We Share initiative includes a traveling exhibition and public dialogue tour that focuses on the intersection of farming, land, ethnic culture and history in Wisconsin. The exhibit will feature the stories, histories, artifacts, images and sounds of six culturally and regionally distinct farms and farm sites and invites visitors to share their own stories, insights and questions. Each stop on the tour will include a three-week run at a community-based venue near one of the six sites and a farm-to-table Community Conversation.
