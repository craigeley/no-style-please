title: Human Powered
---
Human Powered is a podcast that highlights people trying to transform their cities and neighborhoods through humanities inspired projects. The episodes feature art exhibits designed to combat racism, writing workshops to help people overcome the trauma of sex trafficking, oral history projects designed to help people better understand climate change and each other.

> Human Powered is a show about how people make places better. In our first season, we explore Wisconsin together to meet real people and hear in-depth stories that we hope leave you feeling closer to your neighborsâ€”and inspired by where you live.

The show is a collaboration between Wisconsin Humanities and Love Wisconsin and produced by Field Noise Soundworks, including host and co-producer [Jimmy Gutierrez](https://twitter.com/JimmyGootz) and co-producer [Jade Iseri-Ramos](https://twitter.com/jadeiseriramos). The Field Noise team records, writes, and edits all episodes, and the show is mixed by [Final Final v2](https://finalfinalv2.com/).
