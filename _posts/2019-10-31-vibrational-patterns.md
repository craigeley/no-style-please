Carleen Hutchins wasn’t formally trained in violinmaking, but despite that—or because of it—she changed the profession forever. With handfuls of Christmas glitter and a 150-year-old technique, she was able to visualize the vibrations of violin plates, allowing luthiers to rely to on the principles of acoustics instead of just “feel.” Traditionalists were outraged, but Carleen didn’t seem to mind. She had already spent most of her adult life pushing back on the constraints imposed on women in midcentury America. This episode explores Carleen’s life and legacy, the history of acoustics, the act of making sound visible, and our obsession with old Italian violins.

I spent a lot of years studying the history of sound in graduate school, but the first I heard of Ernst Chladni was from some graphic designers. It was early on the development of this show, but a) I knew I wanted the show to have a visual identity that matched the way the show sounded in my head, b) I was already using this “visual identity” stuff as a way to procrastinate actually editing the audio, and c) it was really fun and inspiring to hang out with the team at Art & Sons.

So I’m in their studio one afternoon, and they start showing me images like this. I was shocked. In my experience, the visual language for sound-related things was pretty limited: waveforms, transistor radios, vacuum tubes, phonograph horns. This was something I hadn’t seen before; it had energy, mystery, beauty.

So I go home and start googling the hell out of it. I find all kinds of things, from oddly poetic demonstrations to insanely produced car commercials. But soon I also came across Carleen Hutchins, who applied Chladni’s technique of vibrating plates to the plates of violins. And while I was saddened to learn that Carleen died in 2009, I was excited to learn that there was a recent biography about her, and that the author of that biography, Quincy Whitney, had already done some radio appearances. I devoured the book, wrote her an email, and the episode took off from there.
