title: Voices from the Global Humanities
---
> VOICES allow us to speak with each other. With Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes members, projects, and events spanning the globe’s continents and communities, the ability to hear each other’s voices can help to connect our vibrant community by keeping us up to date with one another’s thoughts, challenges, and efforts to explore and to enrich the humanities everywhere. The audio programs included in these series have been created for everyone as an invitation to think about some of the most substantial questions present in the world today.
