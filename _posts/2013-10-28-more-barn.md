description: Neil Young and Graham Nash walk into a barn…
--- 

Great anecdote on sound from [Cold Splinters](https://www.coldsplinters.com/blog-2013-1/2013/10/more-barn) this morning: it turns out that the first time Graham Nash heard Neil Young’s *[Harvest](https://open.spotify.com/album/2l3QxNo4QubBNmVKxLeum0?si=_yOwmJmtTMuwiwlRxh3kKA)* was on a rowboat in a lake in the middle of Young’s property:

> He has his entire house as the left speaker and his entire barn as the right speaker. And I heard “Harvest” coming out of these two incredibly large loud speakers louder than hell. It was unbelievable. Elliot Mazer, who produced Neil, produced “Harvest,” came down to the shore of the lake and he shouted out to Neil: How was that, Neil? And I swear to god, Neil Young shouted back: More barn!
