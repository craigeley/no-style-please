I'm a cultural historian and radio producer who thinks about and works with sound. I have a Ph.D in American Studies from the University of Iowa, where I wrote a dissertation on the history of recording 'environmental' sounds — from the animal imitations of the vaudeville era through the [whale songs](listening-underwater.html) of the 1970s. While I was researching my dissertation, I had a predoctoral fellowship at the [Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage](https://folklife.si.edu/), where I dug around in the [Folkways](https://folkways.si.edu/) archives.

After grad school, I held a one-year postdoc at the [Humanities Institute](https://hi.psu.edu/) at Penn State, and then a two-year Mellon/ACLS Public Fellowship working with the radio show [To the Best of Our Knowledge](https://www.ttbook.org/). After a stint in academic administration at the UW-Madison Center for the Humanities and the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes, I moved into freelance podcast and audio production work.

My audio production work tends to reflect my academic background and interests in sound, technology, history, and the humanities. If you'd like to collaborate on a project or just talk about bringing a podcast idea to life, [send me an email](mailto:craig@fieldnoise.com?subject=Saw%20your%20website%20and…).
