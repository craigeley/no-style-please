I'm a cultural historian and radio producer who thinks about and works with sound. I have a Ph.D in American Studies from the University of Iowa, where I wrote a dissertation on the history of recording 'environmental' sounds â€” from the animal imitations of the vaudeville era through the [whale songs](listening-underwater.html) of the 1970s. While I was writing I had a predoctoral fellowship at the [Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage](https://folklife.si.edu/), where I mostly messed around in the [Folkways](https://folkways.si.edu/) archives.

After graduating, I held a one-year postdoc at the [Humanities Institute](https://hi.psu.edu/) at Penn State, and then took a two-year Mellon/ACLS Public Fellowship working with the radio show [To the Best of Our Knowledge](https://www.ttbook.org/). After a stint in academic administration, I moved into freelance podcast, audio production, and audio postproduction work.
