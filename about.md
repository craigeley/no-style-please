I'm a cultural historian and radio producer who thinks about and works with sound. I have a Ph.D in American Studies from the University of Iowa, where I wrote a dissertation on the history of recording 'environmental' sounds â€” from the animal imitations of the vaudeville era through the [whale songs](listening-underwater.html) of the 1970s. While I was writing I had a predoctoral fellowship at the [Smith Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage](https://folklife.si.edu/), where I mostly messed around in the [Folkways](https://folkways.si.edu/) archives.
