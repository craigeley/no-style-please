This page is called "writing," but it's really just an old-fashioned blog. Recent articles are below, and I am in the process of slowly adding things from my archive of old Tumblr and Wordpress posts going back to 2010 or so. If you'd like to get infrequently notified of new posts, as well as content like podcast and music recommendations, please sign up for the newsletter.
